    <h1>Privacy Policy for BrandLoop</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 1, 2025</p>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>1. Introduction
Welcome to BrandLoop ("we," "us," "our"). We provide a platform that allows users to be rewarded for creating social media content about brands they love. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our platform and services (the "Services").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

2. Information We Collect
We collect information that you provide directly to us and information that we collect automatically through your use of our Services, specifically via the Facebook API.

A. Information You Provide Directly via Facebook Login:
When you register for BrandLoop using your Facebook account, you authorize us to access certain information from your Facebook profile, based on your permissions. This includes:

Public Profile Information: Your name and profile picture.

Email Address: The primary email address associated with your Facebook account.

B. Information We Collect Automatically from Your Content:
Our core service involves tracking and analyzing content you create related to our partner brands. We only collect information on content where you have explicitly and publicly tagged a partner brand's official Facebook page. This includes:

Post Content: The text, images, and/or videos of your public Facebook post that tags a partner brand.

Engagement Metrics: Publicly available data associated with that post, such as the number of likes, comments, and shares.

Post Metadata: The time and date of the post.

We DO NOT access or store any of your private Facebook posts, messages, or friend lists. Our access is limited to the specific public content you create that is relevant to our partner brands.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Provide and Manage Your Account: To create your BrandLoop profile, authenticate you, and manage your account.

To Calculate Your Mindshare Score: To analyze your submitted content for quality, engagement, and relevance using our proprietary AI scoring engine. This is the core function of our service.

To Administer Rewards: To award you points based on your Mindshare score and allow you to redeem them for coupons, products, or other perks from our brand partners.

To Power Leaderboards and Gamification: To display your public profile information and score on campaign leaderboards.

To Communicate with You: To send you notifications about points earned, new campaigns, and reward unlocks via your provided email address.

To Provide Insights to Brands: To share your public brand-related content and its associated Mindshare score with the respective brand partner. We may also provide brands with aggregated and anonymized data about campaign performance. We will never share your email address with brands without your explicit consent (e.g., for shipping a physical reward).

To Improve Our Services: To analyze usage trends and improve the functionality and user experience of the BrandLoop platform.

4. AI-Powered Analysis (The "Mindshare Score")
A key feature of our Service is the "Mindshare Score," which is calculated using artificial intelligence (AI). When you post content tagging a partner brand, our AI models (which may include third-party services like OpenAI) analyze the text for sentiment and relevance, and the images/videos for visual quality and brand representation. This analysis, combined with engagement metrics, generates the score that determines your rewards.

5. How We Share Your Information
We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information with the following parties:

Partner Brands: The public content you create about a brand, your public profile name/picture, and its Mindshare score will be visible to that specific brand on their BrandLoop dashboard.

Third-Party Service Providers: We use vendors for hosting (e.g., AWS, Vercel), database management (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL), and AI processing (e.g., OpenAI). These vendors only have access to your information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

6. Your Data Rights and Choices
You have control over your personal information.

Access and Update: You can access and update your basic information through your dashboard.

Opt-Out and Deletion: You can stop using our service at any time. You may request the deletion of your BrandLoop account and all associated data by contacting us at [Your Support Email Address Here]. We will process your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Upon deletion, all personal data and tracked content will be permanently removed from our active systems.

7. Data Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

8. Children's Privacy
Our Services are not intended for use by anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date."

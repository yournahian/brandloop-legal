    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Terms of Service for BrandLoop
Effective Date: August 1, 2025

1. Agreement to Terms
By creating an account and using the BrandLoop platform ("Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Services.

2. The Service
BrandLoop provides a platform for social media users ("Users") to be rewarded by brands ("Partners") for creating public User-Generated Content ("UGC") that tags or mentions those Partners on Facebook and other social media platforms.

3. User Accounts
To use BrandLoop, you must be at least 16 years old. You must register for an account using Facebook Login. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

4. User-Generated Content (UGC)
This is the core of our agreement.

Ownership: You retain full ownership of the content (text, photos, videos) you create and post on your own social media profiles.

Grant of License: By creating a public post on Facebook that tags one of our Brand Partners, you are submitting it for consideration in our rewards program. By doing so, you grant BrandLoop and the respective Brand Partner a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and worldwide license to use, distribute, display, reproduce, and analyze that specific piece of UGC.

Use of UGC: This license allows us and our Brand Partners to:

Display your UGC on the BrandLoop platform.

Analyze your UGC to calculate your "Mindshare Score".

Feature your UGC on the Brand Partnerâ€™s own social media channels, websites, and marketing materials, always with attribution to you (e.g., "Photo by @YourUsername").

Your Responsibility: You represent and warrant that you own the UGC or have all necessary rights to grant us this license and that your content does not infringe on the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party.

5. Mindshare Score and Rewards
The "Mindshare Score" is calculated by our proprietary algorithm. It is provided "as-is" and is not subject to appeal. Rewards are offered by our Brand Partners, and BrandLoop acts as a facilitator. We are not responsible for the quality, delivery, or terms of the rewards themselves.

6. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:

Use the Service for any illegal purpose.

Submit content that is hateful, defamatory, or obscene.

Use bots, scrapers, or other automated means to access the Service.

Impersonate any person or entity.

7. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, without notice, for any reason, including for violating these Terms.

8. Disclaimers
The Services are provided "as-is" without any warranties, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Services will always be safe, secure, or error-free.

9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, BrandLoop shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues.
